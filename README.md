    <strong>Give Up - If you're not going to quit, at least make it worthwhile!</strong>

    Give Up is designed to make you quit by finally giving you a reason not to bite your nails, smoke that cigarette or stay up all night! Every time you log a broken habit, you'll make an incredibly kind donation to a charity of your choice. Doesn't sound too bad, right? But think about how often you‚Äôve broken that habit in the last day, week, or month. Imagine how much money you could be down by the end of it! If that isn't incentive, then I don't know what is...
